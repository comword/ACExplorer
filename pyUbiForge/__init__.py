"""
	This is a package containing code to access the files from .forge files used by the Anvil game engine
	to store all assets used in the game. It also contains code to extract information from the files when
	they have been decompressed. The format varies slightly between games and the current implementation
	will only work with Assassin's Creed Unity.

	The forge file format is similar to a zip file in concept with folders in the main directory and binary
	files contained within each directory.
	The 'folders' in the top level of the forge file will from this point on be referred to as 'datafiles'.
	The files contained within the datafile all relate to that datafile but vary in format.
